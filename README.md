## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting and solving handwritten mathematical expressions using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The primary objective is to train the YOLO model to accurately recognize digits and mathematical operators, process an image containing a handwritten equation, and then compute and display the solution.

## Features
- **Digit and Operator Detection:** Uses a YOLO model trained on images of handwritten digits (0-9) and mathematical operators (plus, minus, multiplication, division).
- **Equation Extraction:** Capable of extracting and interpreting expressions from images of handwritten text.
- **Solution Computation:** Solves the detected mathematical expression and displays the result.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evyatar1322/Deep-learning-project


### Notes: TODO
- **Repository Links:** Replace placeholders like `https://github.com/your-username/your-project-repository.git` and `your-email@example.com` with actual links and contact details.
- **Dependencies:** You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the Python libraries required for your project.
- **Custom Instructions:** Tailor the installation and usage instructions according to the specific details of your project setup and environment.
- **License and Acknowledgments:** Modify these sections as needed to appropriately credit any resources or individuals that contribute to your project.

This README provides a clear and structured way for users to understand, set up, and use your project effectively.
